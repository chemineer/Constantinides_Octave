%Chapter 7: Linear and Nonlinear Regression Analysis %%Examples%%  Example7_1.m   Uses the nonlinear regression program (NLR.m and statistics.m) to determine%                 the parameters of two differential equations which represent the kinetics%                 of penicillin fermentation.  The equations are fitted to experimental data.%%Methods%%  NLR.m          Least squares multiple nonlinear regression using the Marquardt and %                 Gauss-Newton methods.  The program can fit simultaneous ordinary differential%                 equations, and/or algebraic equations to multiresponse data.%  statistics.m   Performs a series of statistical tests on the data being fitted and on the %                 regression results.%%Functions%%  Ex7_1_func.m   Contains the model equations for cell growth and penicillin formation used %                 in Example7_1.m.%  stud.m         Evaluates the Student t distribution.%
